"""
Per-org API key authentication.

This is deliberately minimal, not a full user-account system, because the
threat this addresses is narrow: with no auth at all, any client on the
public internet could enumerate sequential /policies/{id} and read every
org's draft policy text. A single shared API key would only half-fix that
(a leaked key still exposes every org to every other org); a full login
system is disproportionate for a tool with no human end users, only
server-to-server callers.

So: each API key maps to exactly one org. A key authenticates a caller as
that org and nothing else. Ownership checks (see routers/policies.py) then
ensure a caller can only ever create or read drafts under their own org.

Keys are read from the API_KEYS env var as "key1:org_one,key2:org_two".

    FastAPI dependency. Validates X-API-Key against configured keys using a

    timing), and returns the org name that key belongs to.

    Header is declared optional (default None) rather than required,

    function and both return the same 401 — otherwise FastAPI's own
    request validation intercepts a missing required header and returns
